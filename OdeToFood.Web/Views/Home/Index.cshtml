        @*without a specific type definition, we need to give the full reference to Enumerable*@
        There are @Enumerable.Count(Model) restaurants in the database.

        @*Alternatively, once the type definition is made at the start, we can just call methods on that type*@
        Yes, there really are @Model.Count() restaurants stored here.
